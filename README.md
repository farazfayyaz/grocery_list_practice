# grocery_list_practice

A challenge to practice basic web development using HTML, CSS and JavaScript. As I am learning how to utilize frameworks, I wanted to make sure that I do not forget the basics and how to create web apps with the basic logic.

Frameworks help simplify the work but it is easy to forget how to create things from scratch. I wanted to sharpen my understanding of basic development so I can overcome any challenges I may face with modern frameworks.
